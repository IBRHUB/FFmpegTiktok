### TikTok 4K Glitch Exporter

This PowerShell script processes videos before uploading them to TikTok. TikTok usually reduces quality during upload, which makes videos look worse. This script enhances colors, sharpness, and encoding settings to keep the original quality as much as possible.

## Requirements
- PowerShell  
- FFmpeg  

## How to Run
Open PowerShell and paste the following command:

```powershell
iwr 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBRHUB/GlitchExporter/refs/heads/main/Glitch%20Exporter.ps1' | iex
```
## Uploading to TikTok
When uploading the video to TikTok:
First upload it as Private for about 5 minutes.
After that, change the video setting from Private to Public
